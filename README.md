# 🎶🍴 Tone and Tongue  

**Tone and Tongue** is an experimental React app that invites users to explore the relationship between **taste** and **sound**.  
Inspired by the sensory crossover between food and music, it allows you to configure a **synthesizer** based on the taste of specific foods.  

Built with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev), it’s a playful way to imagine what flavors might sound like.

## 🎨 Inspiration  
This project is about **synesthesia** — the blending of senses.  
- What does **sweet** sound like?  
- Can **bitter** be translated into tones?  
- How does **umami** resonate musically?  

Tone and Tongue is an invitation to **play, listen, and taste** in new ways.
